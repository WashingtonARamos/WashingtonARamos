Hi, I'm Washington A. Ramos

I'm mainly a C# programmer and mostly deal with Microsoft technologies, specially Azure products. I've been working with Azure Functions, Pipelines, API Management, Blob Storage and other things that touches these topics in the backend zone. I've also worked a little with JavaScript, Apigee and React in recent years and Android, UWP and WPF in the past, but front-end isn't a thing for me anymore.
